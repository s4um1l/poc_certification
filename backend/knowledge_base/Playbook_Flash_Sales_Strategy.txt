# Playbook: Flash Sales Strategy

**Objective:** To drive a rapid surge in sales, clear specific inventory, acquire new customers, or re-engage existing ones through a time-limited, high-discount event.

**I. Planning Phase (2-4 Weeks Prior)**

  **A. Goals & KPIs:**
    [ ] Define primary goal (e.g., revenue target, units sold of specific SKU, new customer acquisition).
    [ ] Set specific, measurable KPIs (e.g., $X revenue, Y units, Z% conversion rate, A new customers).

  **B. Offer & Product Selection:**
    [ ] Select products/collections for the sale. Consider inventory levels, margins, and strategic goals.
    [ ] Determine the discount structure (e.g., 30-50% off, specific price point). Ensure margins support the discount.
    [ ] Set sale duration (typically 12-48 hours). Define exact start and end times (including timezone).
    [ ] Decide on any purchase limits per customer (if needed).

  **C. Marketing & Promotion:**
    [ ] Develop promotional calendar (teasers, announcement, reminders, launch, final hours).
    [ ] Create all marketing assets (email campaigns, social media posts/ads, website banners, SMS alerts).
    [ ] Segment email lists for targeted messaging (e.g., VIPs get early access).
    [ ] Plan paid ad strategy (channels, budget, targeting).
    [ ] Prepare website updates (homepage banner, dedicated landing page/collection).

  **D. Logistics & Technical Prep:**
    [ ] Coordinate with inventory team: ensure sufficient stock is available and allocated.
    [ ] Coordinate with customer support: brief team on sale details, anticipate increased volume.
    [ ] Technical checks: ensure website/server can handle traffic spike. Test discount codes/automatic discounts thoroughly.
    [ ] Set up tracking (UTM codes, specific analytics views).

**II. Execution Phase (During Sale)**

  [ ] Launch scheduled promotions (emails, social posts, ads).
  [ ] Update website banners/homepage.
  [ ] Monitor sales performance and website stability in real-time.
  [ ] Monitor ad performance and adjust bids/budgets as needed.
  [ ] Engage with customer comments/questions on social media.
  [ ] Send reminder emails/posts (e.g., "12 hours left!").

**III. Post-Sale Phase (Immediately After)**

  **A. Fulfillment & Support:**
    [ ] Disable discount codes/remove sale banners promptly at the end time.
    [ ] Send "Sale Ended" communication (optional, can include thank you or hint at future events).
    [ ] Fulfillment team prioritizes processing the high volume of sale orders.
    [ ] Customer support manages post-sale inquiries.

  **B. Analysis & Reporting (Within 1 Week):**
    [ ] Compile performance report: analyze KPIs vs. goals (revenue, units sold, AOV, conversion rate, traffic sources, new vs. returning customers).
    [ ] Analyze product performance: which items sold best?
    [ ] Calculate profitability/ROI of the flash sale.
    [ ] Gather customer feedback (if available).
    [ ] Document key learnings, successes, and challenges for future flash sales.
    [ ] Share report with relevant stakeholders.

Flash sales should be short (12-48 hours), offer significant discounts (30%+), and be heavily promoted via email and social media starting 24 hours prior.
