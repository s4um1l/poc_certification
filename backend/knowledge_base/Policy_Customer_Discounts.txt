    - **Conditions:** Valid only once per customer/email address. Cannot be combined with other offers.

  **b) Loyalty Program Discounts:**
    - **Structure:** Tiered system based on lifetime spend or points accumulated (e.g., Bronze: 5% off, Silver: 10% off, Gold: 15% off + free shipping).
    - **Mechanism:** Requires customer account creation. Discounts may be automatically applied at checkout when logged in or via unique codes.

    - **Mechanism:** Typically time-limited. May require a code or be automatically applied.
    - **Conditions:** Clearly stated start/end dates, applicable products/collections, and any exclusions (e.g., new arrivals, gift cards).

  **d) Tiered Discounts (Volume/Cart Value):**
    - **Offer:** Increasing discount based on cart total (e.g., 10% off $100+, 15% off $150+).

    - **Conditions:** Time-sensitive, usually single-use.

- **Exclusions:** Discounts typically do not apply to gift cards, taxes, or shipping costs unless specified.
- **Validity:** All promotional codes have expiration dates and usage limits (e.g., one per customer).

**4. Discount Code Management:**

- **Naming Convention:** Use clear, logical names (e.g., SPRING2024, WELCOME10).
- **Testing:** All codes must be tested before promotion begins.
- **Tracking:** Use UTM parameters and platform analytics to track the performance of discount codes.
