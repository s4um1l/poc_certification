# Company Policy: Customer Discounts & Promotions

**1. Overview:**
This policy outlines the types of discounts offered to customers, eligibility requirements, and management procedures to ensure consistency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.
The primary goal of our discount strategy is to attract and retain customers, encourage larger purchases, and drive sales during specific periods, while maintaining healthy profit margins.

**Q: What is the main purpose of this policy?**
**A: To provide a clear framework for offering and managing customer discounts and promotions effectively and profitably.**

**2. Types of Discounts:**

  **a) First-Time Buyer Discount:**
    - **Offer:** 10% off the first order.
    - **Mechanism:** Automatically applied via pop-up/email sign-up or using a specific code (e.g., WELCOME10, NEWFRIEND10).
    - **Conditions:** Valid only once per customer/email address. Cannot be combined with other offers. Minimum purchase value may apply if specified.
    - **Goal:** To attract new customers, convert initial interest into a sale, and gather customer email for future marketing.
    - **Consideration:** Monitor for potential abuse (e.g., multiple sign-ups with different emails). Ensure discount does not make initial order unprofitable.

  **b) Loyalty Program Discounts:**
    - **Structure:** Tiered system based on lifetime spend or points accumulated (e.g., Bronze: 5% off, Silver: 10% off, Gold: 15% off + free shipping).
    - **Mechanism:** Requires customer account creation. Discounts may be automatically applied at checkout when logged in or via unique codes.
    - **Details:** Refer to the separate Loyalty Program Documentation for tier specifics, point accumulation rules (e.g., 1 point per $1 spent), and redemption options (e.g., $5 off for 100 points).
    - **Goal:** To reward repeat customers, increase customer retention, and foster a sense of community.
    - **Consideration:** The cost of loyalty rewards should be factored into overall marketing budget and product pricing. Program complexity should be balanced with ease of understanding for customers.

  **c) Promotional / Seasonal Sales:**
    - **Offer:** Varies (e.g., % off specific collections like "20% off Summer Collection", site-wide sales like "Black Friday 25% Off Everything", Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) on selected items).
    - **Mechanism:** Typically time-limited. May require a code (e.g., SUMMER20, BF25) or be automatically applied at checkout. Promotions are announced via email, website banners, and social media.
    - **Conditions:** Clearly stated start/end dates, applicable products/collections, and any exclusions (e.g., new arrivals, already discounted items, gift cards). Limited stock may apply.
    - **Goal:** To drive sales during specific periods, clear out old inventory, and attract customers with time-sensitive offers.
    - **Consideration:** Frequent high-discount sales can devalue the brand or train customers to wait for promotions. Ensure sufficient inventory for popular sale items.

  **d) Tiered Discounts (Volume/Cart Value):**
    - **Offer:** Increasing discount based on cart total (e.g., 10% off $100+, 15% off $150+, $20 off $200+).
    - **Mechanism:** Usually applied automatically at checkout once the cart value threshold is met.
    - **Goal:** To encourage customers to increase their average order value (AOV).
    - **Consideration:** Discount tiers should be set at levels that are achievable for a significant portion of customers but also incentivize increased spending.

  **e) Abandoned Cart Recovery:**
    - **Offer:** Small incentive (e.g., 5-10% off or free shipping) to encourage completion of purchase.
    - **Mechanism:** Sent via automated email sequence after a cart is abandoned for a set period.
    - **Conditions:** Time-sensitive (e.g., valid for 48 hours), usually single-use. May exclude certain products.
    - **Goal:** To recover potentially lost sales by reminding and incentivizing customers who showed purchase intent.
    - **Consideration:** Avoid being overly aggressive with abandoned cart emails, which could annoy customers. Test different incentive levels.

**Q: Can multiple discounts be used on a single order?**
**A: Generally, no. Only one discount code can be applied per order unless a specific promotion explicitly states otherwise (e.g., an automatic free shipping threshold might be met while also using a percentage-off code for items).**

**3. General Conditions & Exclusions:**
- **Stacking:** Generally, only one discount code can be applied per order unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g., free shipping threshold met alongside a percentage off).
- **Exclusions:** Discounts typically do not apply to gift cards, taxes, or shipping costs unless specified. Some products (e.g., limited editions, partner products) may be excluded from all or certain promotions.
- **Validity:** All promotional codes have clearly defined expiration dates and usage limits (e.g., one per customer, total number of redemptions).
- **Fair Use:** The company reserves the right to withdraw or amend a discount or promotion at any time in case of abuse or unforeseen circumstances.

**4. Discount Code Management:**
- **Creation:** Codes are created in the e-commerce platform (Shopify Discounts section) by the Marketing or E-commerce Manager.
- **Naming Convention:** Use clear, logical, and often campaign-specific names (e.g., SPRING2024, WELCOME10, LOYALTYSHIP). Avoid confusing or easily guessable codes if unintended wide use is a concern.
- **Testing:** All codes must be thoroughly tested before promotion begins. This includes:
    - Verifying the correct discount amount/type is applied.
    - Checking start and end dates/times.
    - Ensuring conditions (minimum spend, specific products) are correctly enforced.
    - Testing compatibility with other site features and across different browsers/devices.
- **Tracking:** Use UTM parameters for links sharing discount codes and leverage e-commerce platform analytics to track the performance of discount codes. Key metrics include:
    - Redemption rate (number of times code used / number of times code was offered or available).
    - Average Order Value (AOV) for orders using the discount.
    - Impact on sales of specific products or collections.
    - New customer acquisition through the discount.
    - Overall profitability of the promotion.
- **Security:** For high-value discounts, consider measures to prevent widespread unauthorized sharing or abuse, such as unique codes per user where feasible.

**5. Approval:**
Major promotional campaigns or significant discount offers (e.g., those exceeding a 20% discount on a large portion of inventory, or lasting longer than one week) require approval from the Head of Marketing/E-commerce Director. A brief proposal outlining the offer, target audience, expected impact, and risk assessment should be submitted.

**Q: Who needs to approve a major discount campaign?**
**A: The Head of Marketing or the E-commerce Director.**

**6. Glossary of Terms:**
  - **AOV (Average Order Value):** The average total value of orders placed by customers over a specific period.
  - **BOGO (Buy One Get One Free):** A promotion where a customer buys one item and gets another item (often the same or a related item) for free or at a reduced price.
  - **UTM Parameters:** Tags added to a URL that help track the source, medium, and campaign name of website traffic, often used to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns including those with discount codes.
  - **Stacking:** Applying multiple discounts or promotional offers to the same order.
  - **Churn:** The rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period. While not directly in this policy, understanding churn helps appreciate the value of retention-focused discounts like loyalty programs.
